# Generate Plaxis command list

Quick and dirty Matlab code to assign arbitrary pile / putty geometries in Plaxis through a list of commands. See attached video: https://youtu.be/shbd41XvweM

Basically it just chops the pile up in slices and assigns a different linear distribution to the normal stress on the rock to approximate the prescribed one.

TODO:
- Convert to Python
- Add export options to streamline the development of p-y curves
